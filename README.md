Pebble watchface which shows custom date below the time.

To install on your watch:

- Go to cloudpebble.net then import this project.
- Edit pebble-js-app.js with your own URL, which returns short (<30 characters) of plain text

(In my case, I wrote a service to display top trending twitter tags, and current BTC/USD price)
